Rachel is the absolute best!,"From my first telephone contact with Rachel, it was an absolute pleasure to deal with Flashbay. As a retired judge, I think I know good character when I see it, and Rachel at definitely has it. The customer service I received was impeccable.

Rachel is an extremely personable, kind and intelligent individual--she is the kind of employee every business hopes to find. She kept up with my order (and the subsequent changes I made) quickly and seemingly effortlessly. The process was smooth and efficient. She answered all my questions promptly and kept up with me and my order continuously through the quick turnaround from initial order to my receipt of the items, which came today. They are absolutely perfect and exactly what I envisioned.

Without hesitation, I highly recommend Flashbay. And if you are fortunate enough to have Rachel handle your order, you will be very pleased with the service you receive.

Respectfully submitted,
Izzie",

Mixed Signals,"Our overall experience with Flashbay was positive, resulting in a high-quality product. However, there was a minor hiccup that caught us off guard. When we were ready to proceed with our order, we were informed that the product had to be shipped to the billing address, with no option for separate shipping addresses. This was a departure from our usual experiences with vendors, as we routinely handle orders on behalf of our clients.

This deviation from the norm raised concerns and almost led us to explore other options for our business needs. Fortunately, the Flashbay team, during my ordering process, accommodated our request and allowed a separate shipping address. While we appreciate their flexibility in this instance, it has given us some pause about future orders.

It is our sincere hope that Flashbay reevaluates and potentially revises this policy in the future. Our team was genuinely impressed with the quality of the notebooks we received, and we would gladly consider ordering from Flashbay again if this shipping address restriction were addressed.",

It was easy to ask for a quote, approve the design, and place the final order, and Nick checked in every step of the way to keep us updated on what was going on and see if we had any questions. Mugs just arrived and they look great, exactly like the proofs. Great experience and will definitely order again if I need any more personalized staff gifts.",

Then I started working with Justin Bamberg. He was so professional and knew everything about your products. Answering all my questions and had the best follow through!! Justin is a phenomenal ambassador for FlashBay. He emailed me and made sure you guys were always on the forefront of my mind as it pertains to swag. As he and I went back and forth, several times. I decided that the best and only solution was ordering from your company - all credited to Justin Bamberg. He is the one that helped close this deal. I plan to order more items. And I have already told my associates and colleagues about your company. And, in closing - I am giving them Justin’s contact information.

Something that didn't require a straw, as those are a pain to clean. And, I wanted it to have a relief hole for venting as you're drinking from it. Some of them you have to stop drinking to let air back in, these have a vent hole. I also like the little locking tab that will keep it from opening while it's in a backpack or it it drops.

Great Product & Great Support. Flashbay exceeded my expectations.,"Flashbay exceeded my expectations in design, product quality, and account support.

I ordered 50 of the ""Traveler 750ml"" water bottle with a custom print logo. The product looked good online and in proofs, but the design and overall quality was even better than I imagined it would be. My partner described the finished product as ""insanely cute!"" adding ""I LOVE them."" There is nothing cheap or generic feeling about the finished product we received.

I found Flashbay through an internet search for ""custom aluminum water bottles,"" and I have never done business with them prior to this purchase. The per-unit cost of these bottles was a little greater than some other vendors I was considering. But I went with Flashbay because of the specific visual appeal of the Traveler bottle and, ultimately, the attentiveness of the Account Manager (Melvin). His assistance and communication were terrific at every step of the way. He even followed up after the order arrived to ensure that it met my expectations. I am very satisfied with my entire experience and I plan to order from Flashbay again.",

Flash Drives for Driving Attention at a Trade Show,"I needed branded flash drives for a trade show, but have never ordered custom. I found Flashbay, asked for a quote, what I got was way more. Donovan was so nice, not only did he send samples of the different types, and mock ups about how things would look, he was great at making suggestions to make things look better - like put the website on one side and the logo on the other. Sounds simple, but I wouldn't have thought to do it.

Today the flash drives came, and they are awesome. They are smaller than I thought they'd be, because they plug right in. They are sleek and cool, my business is about dog poop, so you've gotta have a high design game to make people give a poop and take notice.

It's nice when things that aren't 'the meat' of what you do, are made easy, too often this is where you end up spending your time. Donovan at Flashbay made my life easier, the drives were well priced and I couldn't be happier. I think they are going to stand out in all the best ways!

Errors crop up easily in an all-electronic interaction, especially for orders involving custom work. I work in technical customer support in biotechnology, designing custom-synthesized molecules, and from this I've learned that there is no substitute for working with a human that knows another company's system. I was much more confident when Hieu contacted me and shepherded the order though.

I have hardly ever reviewed a vendor…Absolutely fantastic,"I have hardly ever reviewed a vendor ever. I just felt like I had to review Chris and his service to me with Flashbay. He stayed on the phone and listen to everything I had to say very carefully. He took every concern that I had and made it a non-concern. He was absolutely one of the finest customer service agents I have ever had the privilege to deal with. My products came when he said they were going to. They were in better shape than I could’ve ever imagined. There were a follow up emails and phone calls from Chriss to make sure that I was more than happy and if there was anything that he can do to make it that way just in case. In these days you do not find that type of customer service anymore. Whatever you are paying him is not enough in my opinion.

I just can’t say enough about Chris and how he treated me over the phone as a professional and as a client.

I look forward to a long lasting relationship with Flashbay.

We got exactly what we needed: the Memo USB Drive. Our logo is Laser-etched and looks great, and the drive seems to be a good quality and value!
I was surprised when I removed the drive from the port the first time, because it automatically retracts back into its protective housing. Because I forget to close drives sometimes and tend to lose caps when they have them, I think that it's actually a good thing.
The drive will has a slim profile and will fit into almost any USB port.

"Flashbay exceeds expectations, again.","We have used Flashbay for our business' file delivery needs for a few years now and just this year decided to try out their packaging solutions tailored specifically for the USB drives we've been using. After an exhausting hunt through the jungle of small business packaging solutions online, we decided we'd give Flashbay's options a try and were pleasantly surprised when they arrived. Not only did they arrive incredibly quickly (as we've come to expect from Flashbay), the delivery boxes themselves feel robust, high quality, and of course match the fit and finish of the drives they are meant to house. We couldn't be happier with the product and will definitely commit to using these products for the foreseeable future.

Additionally, the customer service couldn't be snappier with their response times, follow-ups, and our personal rep Donovan has always been exceptionally helpful and easy to reach. We don't usually take the time to write about something as simple as flash drives and their boxes, but we felt compelled to share our experience with other small business owners looking for a similar file/packing solution. 10/10 would recommend.",

I ultimately received (after battling with FedEx signature requirement that had been canceled) a high quality rendering on USB of the logo that I adapted, in 3 drafts from concept/sample - that was beyond the scope of development services offered by Flashbay - to first proof, that allowed me to improve the application to USB-scale; to second proof, that thoroughly confused the revisions I had requested but DID give me enough information to add an additional line; to 3rd/final proof, after my 2nd attempt at explaining what I wanted actually yielded what I expected.

I was told my order would arrive at my home within seven business days, and it did. I received a follow-up phone call from Donovan checking whether or not I was satisfied with the masks, which of course, I was. I highly recommend Flashbay.

Ironically, when ordering, emails, phone calls and all kinds of attention. Too bad. I will follow up with end result. Hopefully this review can be updated soon",

Accidentally Perfect,"I searched extensively for custom masks for my company. I had several criteria that each needed to be addressed.

I found outrageous prices from a lot of the traditional vendors and some that have recently materialized trying to capitalize on the trend. I stumbled across Flashbay entirely by chance via a Google search. I forget if I called or emailed first but I was contacted immediately. My point of contact was Olivia. She was incredible for each step of the order. I mentioned my criteria, right? Well, she wanted to make sure I had no questions about my choice of mask so she offered to send me a sample of a couple of masks. All of this happened in less than a week! The service was perfect, the product exceeded expectations, production and delivery was very fast. We will be ordering more masks soon as this was such a positive experience.

My order was small, part of a mask promotion for my church philanthropic group. I suspect that when our parishioners see the masks, we’ll need to place another order: they look great, feel great. Turnaround time was speedy.

True Customer Service,"Mistakes problems, accidents, and such will always happen, and great customer service has to do with how a company responds when something goes wrong. I ordered a batch of 100 USB thumb drives from my sales rep, Kris. It was a reorder of a previous batch and when they arrived, we noticed a considerable performance difference between the old ones and the new ones - the new ones markedly slower. Instead of telling me that the old ones were unusually fast and the new ones were still within an acceptable performance range (they might have been on the slow end of passable given the data transfer range information that was shared with us), Flashbay really came through, treated us fairly, and made it right and no cost to us!! Because they were so aweeome to deal with, they have earned a customer for life!",negative
